# Design and UI System

### Design Principles

- Minimal: Only essential UI elements, no clutter.
- Readable: Clear typography, proper spacing, high contrast
- Consistent: Colors, fonts and components reused across the app
- Accessible: Consider dark/light modes and  sufficient contrast for all users
- Focus-first: Design supports content, not distract from it.

### Component Guidelines

- **Buttons:** Minimal outline or filled, consistent padding, consistent rounded corners.
- **Cards / Feed Items:** Simple shadows, consistent spacing, readable typography.
- **Forms / Inputs:** Clear labels, consistent field height, minimal borders.
- **Spacing & Layout:** 8px baseline grid, consistent margins/paddings across components.
- **Icons:** Only used to support content, subtle and uniform in style.

### Dark & Light Mode

- Maintain the same typography, spacing, and layout across themes.
- Backgrounds, text, and accents should always provide sufficient contrast.
