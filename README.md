# Project Overview – FitThreads

FitThreads is a minimalist, text-based social blog built exclusively for fitness-related content. It provides a focused space where people can share and read fitness ideas, thoughts, and experiences without distractions from unrelated topics.

## Goal
To create a fitness-only social platform that prioritizes meaningful discussion, clarity, and relevance over noise and virality.

## Mission
To help people share authentic fitness ideas in a dedicated environment—unlike broad social platforms where fitness content gets lost among unrelated topics.

## Design Inspiration
FitThreads is inspired by Threads by Meta Platforms, Inc., particularly its text-first UI and feed interaction patterns.  
While some interaction logic is similar, all features are independently designed and implemented to support a minimalist, fitness-only experience.

## What It Achieves
- Keeps all content fitness-focused
- Encourages thoughtful reading and writing
- Removes distractions common in mainstream social platforms
- Builds a clean, scalable foundation for a focused fitness community
